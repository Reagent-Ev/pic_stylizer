# pic_stylizer
Simple little program to capture a picture with laptop webcam and stylize the picture using openCV.

The intended purpose was i wanted to create a stylized version of a picture of mine for a profile picture but did not want to use a service or app that i dont
trust with my data/ likeness. So i just decided i would make my own simple program to just take a picture and style it so i know what the code is doing and it runs
locally on my machine.
